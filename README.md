     I’m interested in Machine Learning, Computational Biology, Computer Architecture ...  
     I’m currently learning Clustering and Weakly Supervised Learning ...  
    ️ I’m looking to collaborate on Summer Research, RA, PhD, MPhil ...

     Pronouns: She/Her  
    ⚡ Fun fact: I love my cat very much. He's incredibly adorable,  
    a delightful blend of British Shorthair and American Shorthair heritage. His name is DongTian, which translates to 'winter' in English, because he was born in winter!  
    <br>  
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Civil Aviation ✈️ also holds a special place in my life. Just take a peek at my Gmail address :wink:  
    <br>  
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My favorite singer is a Chinese singer named Zhoushen. His songs can always heal me. Maybe that's because most of his songs are not about love.
