- ⚡ Fun fact: I love my cat😻 very much. He's incredibly adorable, 
a delightful blend of British Shorthair and American Shorthair heritage. His name is DongTian, which translates to 'winter' in English, because he was born in winter!
    <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Civil Aviation ✈️ also holds a special place in my life. Just take a peek at my Gmail address :wink:
    <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My favorite singer is a Chinese singer named Zhoushen. His songs can always heal me. Maybe that's because most of his songs are not about love. 😏
